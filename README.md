==================

Repo for our lab work, private and only available to members.

Take note of example.c/h for examples of how code should be formatted.
All comments of the form //!! Should be noted as being commentary on the example file.
Do not use these in your own sources.

There are also template files to generate sources for you. Makes life easy.
See the repository labelled .my_scripts in github for that. Simply clone it to your $HOME folder
and add the folder itself (.my_scripts) to your $PATH. Then use mkC command to generate source files.
Consult mkC usage on format.
