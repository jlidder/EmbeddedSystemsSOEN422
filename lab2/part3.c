 * Lab 2 - Q3 - Use phase correct PWM to drive the connected motors.
 *              We set 1 motor in forward direction and the 2nd motor in a backward direction.
 *
 * QUESTION: 3.	Write a sketch to set up one PWM to run a motor in 
 *              a “forward” direction, and the second PWM to run the other motor one in 
 *              a “backward direction
